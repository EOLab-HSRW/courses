## Assessment & Grading (TBD)

### Labs

Labs are the way to acquire practical skills that will help you complete the assignments and the final project.

### Assigments

The assignments are designed to help you progress toward the final project.

### Final Project

Self-balancing robot

## Communication Channels & Recommendations

**Moodle**: We will use Moodle to make announcements and provide spaces for submitting assignments.

**Discord**: We use Discord as an open platform for collaboration and communication, so you can use it to share information with us, such as technical issues that may be relevant to others, or you can share resources that you consider valuable. Access will be provided during class (to avoid bots).

**Email**: private matters.

In case of technical issues:
- Describe the problem, try to be provide with the steps to reproduce it.
- Do not copy and paste massive logs (preferably less than 20 lines). If necessary attach a file with the complete logs.
- Add screenshoot if necessary.

## Lab Access & Safety

Room 02.02.510 (IoT Lab) will be available for use throughout the semester.

**Safety**: A brief lab safety introduction is required before using the lab.

**Lab Access**: We operate an open-access policy. If the door is open, you are welcome to come in, take a seat, interact with others, and work. Opening hours are not fixed and depend on the lab staff’s schedule. In general, the lab is open from 10:30 to 17:00. We recommend arranging access with the lab staff or [teaching team](#teaching-team)

**Workspace**: If a space is free, feel free to use it. Please keep the area neat and tidy during and after your work.

**Lab Equipment**: The lab provides the resources you need for assignments, lab work, and the final project. However, before operating any tool or workstation, please ask the lab staff for a brief introduction.

**Loan Policy**: Electronic components and some accessories may be borrowed for home use. To arrange this, please contact a member of the [teaching team](#teaching-team).

Any questions or unexpected situations should be reported to the lab staff immediately.
